            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                   <br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is knowledge exhibited by machines, dissimilar to the common insight showed
                   by people and creatures, which includes awareness and emotionality. The differentiation between the previous 
                   and the last classifications is regularly uncovered by the abbreviation picked. 'Solid' AI is typically 
                   marked as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while endeavors to copy 'common' knowledge have been called 
                   ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence). Driving AI course readings characterize the field as the investigation
                   of "canny specialists": any gadget that sees its current circumstance and makes moves that boost its opportunity 
                   of effectively accomplishing its goals. Colloquially, the expression "man-made brainpower" is regularly used to 
                   depict machines (or PCs) that mirror "psychological" capacities that people partner with the human brain, 
                   for example, "learning" and "issue solving".<br>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to 
                   think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits 
                   associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.<br>The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the 
                   best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers 
                   to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted 
                   by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of 
                   unstructured data such as text, images, or video.<br>As machines become progressively able, assignments considered 
                   to require "knowledge" are regularly eliminated from the meaning of AI, a marvel known as the AI effect. A joke in 
                   Tesler's Theorem says "artificial intelligence is whatever hasn't been done yet." For example, optical character 
                   acknowledgment is much of the time avoided from things viewed as AI, having become a routine technology. 
                   Modern machine capacities for the most part named AI incorporate effectively understanding human speech, contending 
                   at the most significant level in essential game frameworks, (for example, chess and Go), self-governingly working 
                   vehicles, keen steering in substance conveyance organizations, and military simulations.
